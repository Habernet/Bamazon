## Project title
Bamazon! This project containts two Node.js CLI applications that simulate the different sides of a website like Amazon
There is the customer side and the manager side. (bamazonCustomer.js and bamazonManager.js)

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to learn how to bring a database (in this case MySQL) into a Node.js application in order to persist data!
Furthermore we work with the idea of different users working with the database. Customers will usually view and buy something, therefore we will read and update a database.
A manager will have full control, they will be able to read the contents of the database, update the stock, view low stock, add new products...etc.
Here behind these two applications we see the basics of using a database in action (CRUD actions).

## Build status
There is still one more piece of the application that gives a supervisor access to the system. This is not complete yet.
 
## Screenshots
Include logo/demo screenshot etc.
